## Overview

**AI Platform Model** is a domain-agnostic starter for building SaaS products on a Kenya-friendly, global-ready stack. It ships with the parts every product needs and re-implements badly — authentication, role-based access, a wallet and subscription billing system wired to Paystack, and a resilient multi-provider AI layer — so product work can start on day one instead of week three.

It is a **foundation**, not a finished product: no domain tables are included on purpose. Drop your actual entities (listings, courses, orders, whatever the product is) on top.

## Features

| Area | What's included |
|---|---|
| **Auth** | Email/password, Google OAuth, password reset, email verification, secure sessions, protected routes, role-based access (`user` / `admin`) |
| **Database** | One clean Postgres migration — constraints, indexes, triggers, views, RLS on every table |
| **Wallet & billing** | Credit wallet with ledger-enforced balances, one-time payments, monthly subscriptions, Paystack webhooks with HMAC verification, automatic feature unlocking |
| **AI layer** | 8 providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, OpenRouter, Groq, Together AI, Cohere, DeepSeek) behind one interface. A missing key or failed call moves to the next provider automatically — one outage never takes down generation |
| **Storage** | Supabase Storage for user files, Cloudinary for optimized image delivery and transforms |
| **Frontend** | Next.js App Router, Tailwind, a small shadcn-style component set, Framer Motion (used for the AI Playground's message transitions), full PWA support via a hand-written, dependency-free service worker |
| **Deployment** | Cloudflare Pages — no server to manage, edge-served, environment variables set once in the dashboard |

## Architecture

<img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture diagram" width="100%" />

**Request flow:** the client hits Next.js middleware first, which refreshes the Supabase session and gates `/dashboard` and `/admin` by auth state and role. API routes then talk to Supabase (Postgres + RLS as the source of truth), Paystack for payment operations, Cloudinary for image delivery, and the AI provider layer for generation — each of those integrations fails independently without taking the others down.

## Interface preview

The full UI is implemented, not mocked: a marketing landing page, a split-screen auth flow, and a dashboard shell with a persistent sidebar (complete with a live "ledger tape" — a scrolling feed of wallet, subscription, and AI events, which is also the landing page's hero visual).

| Surface | What's there |
|---|---|
| **Landing page** (`/`) | Hero with the ledger tape, feature grid, architecture walkthrough, pricing pulled from the seeded plans |
| **Auth** (`/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) | Split-screen layout, Google OAuth, email verification state, password reset flow |
| **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) | Wallet balance, current plan, recent payments and AI calls |
| **Billing** (`/dashboard/billing`) | Wallet top-up dialog (quick amounts + custom), plan comparison with subscribe buttons, full payment history |
| **AI Playground** (`/dashboard/ai-playground`) | Chat-style interface hitting the failover chain directly — pick a specific provider or leave it on auto |
| **Settings** (`/dashboard/settings`) | Profile (name + Cloudinary-backed avatar upload), password change, light/dark theme toggle |
| **Admin** (`/admin`) | Revenue chart, user list with promote/demote, role-gated via middleware + RLS |

Run `npm run dev` and click through it — there's nothing left to imagine.

```

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/learninghub44/ai-platform-model.git
cd ai-platform-model
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in your keys
```

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor (or `supabase db push` via the CLI).
3. In Supabase → Authentication → Providers, enable Google, and set the site URL / redirect URL to `<your-domain>/auth/callback`.
4. Fill in `.env.local` — Supabase keys, Cloudinary credentials, Paystack keys, and whichever AI provider keys you have. Any AI key left blank is simply skipped; nothing else breaks.
5. `npm run dev`

## Environment variables

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list. Grouped summary:

| Group | Variables |
|---|---|
| Supabase | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` |
| Cloudinary | `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` |
| Paystack | `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY` |
| AI providers | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, `COHERE_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY` |

## Database schema

One migration (`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`) creates everything:

- **`profiles`** — one row per `auth.users`, auto-created on signup via trigger, carries `role` (`user`/`admin`)
- **`wallets`** + **`wallet_transactions`** — balance is derived from the transaction ledger via trigger, never edited directly
- **`subscription_plans`** + **`subscriptions`** — one active subscription per user, enforced with a partial unique index
- **`payments`** — every Paystack transaction, `pending` → `success`/`failed`, linked by `reference`
- **`ai_usage_logs`** — every AI call attempt, successful or not, for observability
- **`files`** — Supabase Storage object metadata, optionally mirrored to Cloudinary
- **Views** — `user_entitlements` (per-user wallet + plan snapshot), `payments_summary` (admin revenue rollup)
- **RLS** — enabled on every table; users see their own rows, an `is_admin()` helper grants admin access

## API routes

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/payments/initialize` | `POST` | Creates a pending payment row, starts a Paystack transaction |
| `/api/payments/verify` | `GET` | Client-side confirmation after redirect back from Paystack |
| `/api/payments/webhook` | `POST` | Source of truth — HMAC-verified Paystack events, unlocks wallet credit / subscription state |
| `/api/ai/generate` | `POST` | Runs the provider failover chain, logs every attempt |

## Deployment — Cloudflare

Cloudflare's classic "static Pages" build path doesn't run API routes, middleware, or server components — and `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` (the old adapter for that) is deprecated. The current, Cloudflare-recommended way to run a full Next.js app like this one is the **OpenNext Cloudflare adapter**, which builds it for Cloudflare Workers. It shows up under the same **Workers & Pages** dashboard section, so the "deploy to Cloudflare" experience is unchanged even though the tooling underneath isn't classic Pages.

The adapter (`@opennextjs/cloudflare`) and `wrangler` are already devDependencies here, with `wrangler.toml` and `open-next.config.ts` checked in.

**Deploy from your machine or CI:**

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler login          # first time only
npm run cf:deploy           # builds with OpenNext, then wrangler deploy
```

**Or connect Git for automatic deploys:**

1. Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → **Create** → **Connect to Git** → select `ai-platform-model`.
2. Build command: `npm run cf:build`. Cloudflare will pick up `wrangler.toml` for the rest.
3. Add every variable from `.env.example` under **Settings → Variables and Secrets**. Use `npx wrangler secret put <NAME>` locally for anything sensitive (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, all AI provider keys) rather than pasting them as plain build variables.
4. Set the Paystack webhook URL to `https://<your-worker-subdomain>.workers.dev/api/payments/webhook` (or your custom domain, once attached).
5. Push to `main` — Cloudflare rebuilds and redeploys automatically.

Requires `compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"` or later and the `nodejs_compat` flag — both already set in `wrangler.toml`. This tooling moves fast; if something here looks off by the time you deploy, check [developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/nextjs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/nextjs/) for the latest.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Domain-specific product tables (define once the product spec is set)
- [ ] Transactional email beyond Supabase's built-in auth emails
- [ ] Mobile-native drawer nav (currently a lightweight `<details>`-based menu)
